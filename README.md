# Predictive Modelling Using Social Profile in Online P2P Lending Market
It is very important that borrowers pay the loans. We study the borrower-,loan- and group- related determinants of performance predictability in an
online P2P lending market by conceptualizing financial and social strength to predict borrower rate and whether the loan would be timely paid. We tried to create a model that determines the risk of the debt using the given data.
# Dataset Structure
Original dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Our label is LoanStatus. 
The data was offered by Technocolabs for a project .
